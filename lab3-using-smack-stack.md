# Deploy an Application that uses the SMACK Stack

In this final lab, you will use the SMACK stack installed previously. The
application that you will be deploying will use the SMACK default paramaters
including VIPs and load balancers.

## Execute the Install SMACK Application Script

On your bootstrap node, in the `1.11` directory, excute the script and follow
the prompts:

`./install_smack_application.sh`

The script actually installs two applications. 

1. `/oscon-smack/dashboard/`: This application

2. `/oscons-smack/ingest`:

## Conclusion

Now that you have finished the labs...
